Jasmine-Coffeescript
====================

Experiment based on the Tutsplus tutorial on TDD with Jasmine and Coffeescript. First time working with the Github GUI app.

Tutorial scripts and templates shopuld have been modified sufficiently to make them "my own".


h4. Testing
If everything is set up with Grunt simply type 
*grunt jasmine* to run Jasmine specs in a terminal.
