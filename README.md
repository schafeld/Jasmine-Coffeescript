Jasmine-Coffeescript
====================

Experiment based on the Tutsplus tutorial on TDD with Jasmine and Coffeescript. First time working with the Github GUI app. Added Grunt to the mix.

Tutorial scripts and templates should have been modified sufficiently to make them "my own".


### Testing
When everything is set up with Grunt simply type 
    grunt jasmine
to run Jasmine specs in a terminal.

Type 
    grunt watch
to continuously cover any saved code changes.
