Jasmine-Coffeescript
====================

Experiment based on the Tutsplus tutorial on TDD with Jasmine and Coffeescript. First time working with the Github GUI app. Added Grunt to the mix. Added linting with jshint.

Tutorial scripts and templates should have been modified sufficiently to make them "my own".


### Testing
When everything is set up with Grunt simply type 
    `grunt jasmine` 
to run Jasmine specs in a terminal. 

Type 
    `grunt watch` 
to continuously cover any saved code changes.
